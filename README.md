“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.” - Einstein
"Paradise is built and maintained by robots."

This is a small amount of my research in AI with links to papers and jupyter notebooks.

## What is the human loss function?

We need to find out a general loss function so that AGI can learn from, something in the form of below

```python
def agi_loss_fn(?,?,?...):
  """
  A meta loss function, similar to that of a human
  """
  pass
```

## Some things I need to do

- Math
  - Back prop
  - Forward pass
  - Linear Algebra
- Libraries
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
- Neural Network from scratch in C
  - Make sure I understand backpropagation at the lowest level
  - Nuts and Bolts approach
- Find reading list
  - Binder full of most important papers for ML
  - Really read and understand
  - Read multiple times
  - Highlight them
- How to build a datacenter
