# Next Steps
* Neural Network from scratch in C
  * Make sure I understand backpropagation at the lowest level
  * Nuts and Bolts approach
* Find reading list
  * Binder full of most important papers for ML
  * Really read and understand 
  * Read multiple times
  * Highlight them


# AGI Loss Function:

We need to find out a general loss function so that AGI can learn from, something in the form of below

```python
def agi_loss_fn(?,?,?...):
  """
  A meta loss function, similar to that of a human
  """
  pass
```
