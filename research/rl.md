# Reinforcement Learning

- Agent's reward policy should keep the worst mistakes (most negative rewards) and keep only the best reward in mind (best reward). I remember how I best did something, and the worst outcomes of actions that I took when learning something (i.e. don't forget to add + C when doing integrals).
